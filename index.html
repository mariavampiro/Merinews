        <p><strong>Tasmanian devils have been reintroduced into the wild in mainland Australia for the first time in 3,000 years.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>   
            Conservation groups released 26 of the mammals into a large sanctuary in Barrington Tops, north of Sydney.
        </p>   
            It's thought that packs of dingoes helped eradicate them on the mainland.
         <p>   
            There are still some on the island state of Tasmania but their numbers have dwindled over the past two decades.
         </p>   
            The Tasmanian devil, classified as endangered, gets its name from its high-pitch squeal and is renowned for fighting over access to animal carcases, which it grinds with the bone-crushing force of its jaws.
         <p>   
            Animal experts say they pose no threat to humans or agriculture.</p>

            Conservation group Aussie Ark worked with other animal groups to release the Tasmanian devils into the 1,000-acre fenced sanctuary. The animals have been placed in the sanctuary to help keep their chances of survival high. They have no supplied food, water or shelter.
         </p>
            The first group of 15 were released in March. After the animals showed signs of thriving in their environment, a further 11 were released in September.
         <p>
            Young, healthy Tasmanian devils were selected in the hope they would be ready for breeding season, set to begin in February.
         </p>       
            "They're free. They're out there," Tim Faulkner, president of Aussie Ark, told National Geographic. "We've got some basic means of keeping an eye on them. But essentially, now it's<strong> over to the devils to do what they do.</strong>"
         </p>
            Another 40 are set to be released into the sanctuary over the next two years.
