                <P>The coastal city of Qingdao confirmed a small number of cases on Sunday</P>
                <h2>
                    The Chinese city of Qingdao is testing its entire population of nine million people for Covid-19 over a period of five days.
                </h2>
                <p>The mass testing comes after the discovery of a dozen cases linked to a hospital treating coronavirus patients arriving from abroad.</p>
                <p>In May, China tested the entire city of Wuhan - home to 11 million people and the epicentre of the global pandemic.</p>
                <p>The country has largely brought the virus under control.</p>
                <p>That is in stark contrast to other parts of the world, where there are still high case numbers and lockdown restrictions of varying severity.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>In a statement posted to Chinese social media site Weibo, Qingdao's Municipal Health Commission said six new cases and six asymptomatic cases had been discovered.</p>
                <p>All the cases were linked to the same hospital, said the state-run Global Times.</p>
                <p>The Chinese authorities now have a strategy of mass testing even when a new coronavirus cluster appears to be relatively minor, correspondents say.</p>
                <h3>
                    How will the testing work?
                </h3>
                <p>The National Health Commission said on Monday that "the whole city will be tested within five days".</p>
                <p>Some 114,862 people - including medical staff and newly hospitalised patients in the city's hospitals - had already tested negative, Qingdao's health commission said.</p>
                <p>Videos circulating online showed residents lining up late on Sunday to get tested, said the Global Times, adding that some of these test points were open from 07:00 to 23:00.</p>
                <p>The new cases come a week after China's Golden Week holiday - which saw millions travel across the country.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>A Global Times report quoting the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said the coastal city had received 4.47 million passenger trips over this period.</p>

                <p>The nearby city of Jinan, in the same province as Qingdao, called for anyone who had visited the city since 23 September to get tested, according to a report by The Paper.</p>
                <p>Earlier last month, Qingdao announced that two port workers who handled imported seafood had tested positive. They were not known to have infected anyone else.</p>
                <p>Daily coronavirus infections have fallen drastically in China, and for the most part the country appears to have recovered from the worst.</p>
                <p>China currently has 91,305 virus cases and the death toll stands at 4,746, according to WHO data.</p>
                <h3>
                    How did they test Wuhan?
                </h3>
                <p>China said 11 million people in the city had been tested in 10 days earlier this year.</p>
                <p>The BBC's Reality Check estimated the figure was closer to 9 million, but still a significant number of people.</p>
                <p>Hundreds of testing centres were opened, with thousands of staff involved.</p>
                <p>They also mobilised teams to test disabled people, the elderly and those vulnerable in their own homes.</p>
                <p>One of the ways they sped up the process was to use batch- or pool-testing.</p>
                <p>In this process, a batch of between five and 10 samples was tested. Only if a sample tested positive would the team go back to carry out individual tests to see who was positive within the batch.</p>
